## How it works
![SS](https://github.com/randze/my-team-app/blob/master/img/app-how.jpg)
- run node app.js
- answer manager questions
- move on to adding individual engineers/interns in the team
- select "done" when complete
- a new team.html will be created in the output folder

## Improvements to be done
- Refactoring code
- Polish UI
